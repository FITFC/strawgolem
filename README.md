# Straw Golem
This is a spiritual successor to the original Straw Golem mod.

This mod adds a spawnable straw golem. It's a very weak golem and flees whenever hostile mobs come nearby.
It can harvest and deliver crops to a nearby chest

## Lifespan
It has a limited lifespan (7 ingame days), which goes down faster when in the rain or cold, or when carrying a heavy object (shivering indicates the prior two conditions, a custom animation the latter)

As it decays, there are visual changes to the texture, and the golem's max health is capped.

Lifespan is increased by feeding the golem wheat. This also heals it. Lifespan can be increased up to 25% above the default (7 ingame days).

## Hunger
The golem gets hungry over time as well. When it is hungry, it will sit down, display a cute animation and pout until it is fed.

Golems are fed using apples, and can also be tempted using an apple (they'll follow you when you're holding one)

## Miscellaneous
If struck by lightning, the golems can turn into a 'strawng golem', which functions similar to an iron golem, except protecting other straw golems instead of villagers

## Config
The mod is made to be highly configurable. Users can toggle optional features (like lifespan, hunger), set whitelisted and blacklisted crops, tweak lifespan and hunger lengths, etc.

## Compat
Out of the box compat for most crops, as well as HWYLA for tooltip (showing the golem hunger and lifespan)
